# MIS576-Project-Management
My assignments and final project from the course MIS576 Project Management from WPI.

Course Overview: I find this course from Prof. Delvy most helpful since I've leraned to solve problems from PM's perspective and not from engineering perspective.
This whole course is understanding this non-technical(non-engineering perspective) dimesion about solving problems. One of the best courses I've taken in WPI offered by Prof. Paul Delvy.
